# About me ‚ú®
Hi, I'm Domiziano.

I'm currently studying for my master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Rome "La Sapienza". 

I obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Rome "La Sapienza" in March 2022. If you want you can read my thesis (written in Italian) [here](https://github.com/DomizianoScarcelli/bachelor-thesis).

I have some experience in:
- Web Development
- Mobile Development
- Backend Development (REST APIs)
- Machine Learning, using PyTorch as a framework and Pyspark for distributed computation.

During my university career and during my free time, I managed to carry out some projects, that can be found on my GitHub page. 

I‚Äôm familiar with the following programming languages:
- HTML
- CSS (SCSS and Tailwind)
- Javascript / Typescript

- Python
- SQL 
- Swift

Inside the front-end development, I have experience with the following technologies:
- React
- React Native

Regarding the back end:
- Docker
- MinIO
- Django
- FastAPI
- Express
- MySQL / Postgres using Prisma
- MongoDB using Mongoose and Pymongo

Regarding the cloud:
- AWS (ECS, RDS, S3)
- Terraform

During the development of some projects, I also used some programs like:
- Figma / Adobe XD
- Photoshop
- Premiere Pro / Da Vinci Resolve
